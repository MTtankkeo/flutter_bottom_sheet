## 1.0.0
- A initial verison.

## 1.1.0
- Updated to allow the bottom sheet to be laid out at its minimum size.

## 1.2.0
- Added `builder` to build the inner content of the bottom sheet.
- Inner content now automatically applies SafeArea, removing the need to wrap ScrollView separately.
- Renamed the previous `builder` to `sheetBuilder` to clarify it builds the card-style container inside the bottom sheet.
